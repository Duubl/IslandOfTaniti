                    <b>An Island of Wonders</b>
                    <p>Taniti may just be a small island contained within the world's largest ocean, but that doesn't stop the island from offering a wide array of geographical features, whether it's white sand beaches, rocky, jagged cliff edges, lush tropical rainforests, or even an active volcano. This diverse landscape has served as an excellent getaway for those who wish to escape from the bustle of the big city, or even if they are just looking for a new sight. Taniti has it all.</p>

                    <b>A Rich History</b>
                    <p>Taniti has been continuously inhabited for approximately 1200 years. Legend says the first Tanitians rode upon a gargantuan sea serpent, named "Tanihalotep" which roughly translates to "the one who parts the waves". Tanihalotep is a central figure of worship in Tanitian culture, during your stay you may notice intricate carvings of sea serpents of many of the buildings, even simple homes. An image of the great serpent has been thought to endow your family with a "forward momentum", just as Tanihalotep had when swimming across the Pacific Ocean. <br><br> For those willing to brave the jungle, you may find yourself face to face with more ancient carvings of the sea serpent. Some of these carvings have been thought to been created before 1200 years ago, indicating a much greater history than previously thought!</p>
