                    <p>Kailani is a sleek and modern dining experience in the center of Taniti. Kailani is very popular among young adults and older professionals alike.

                    <b>Paipai</b>
                    <p>Looking for something more low-key and engulfed in Taniti's traditional culture? Paipai serves as a very popular dining experience outside of the town centers. As you head East from the town center, the jungle starts to creep up, and right on that border lies Paipai. Paipai primarily serves traditional Tanitian food, which has allowed it to enjoy a reputation from both locals and tourists alike.</p>

                    <b>Bikeka Falls</b>
                    <p>Bikeka falls serves as the transition point where the Mateki river goes from harsh rapids to a soft, calm flowing river. Bikeka falls is about 465 feet tall and 120 feet wide, which gives it a domineering presence over the dense Tanitian jungle. It is also not uncommon to spot plenty of wildlife around the falls, whether to bathe or take a drink of the fresh water.</p>

                    <b>Mount Ululoa</b>
                    <p>Of course Mount Ululoa serves as the primary stand out feature of the Tanitian islands. Chances are, as soon as you see the islands your eyes are immediately brought to the presence of Mount Ululoa. From almost every point on the island, you can see at least a little bit of the mountain. Many traditions surround the mountain as well, so it is not uncommon to see many shrines and sculptures carved into the rocky outcroppings on this scenic mountain.</p>

                    <b>Cliffs of Paenhanga</b>
                    <p>Many tourists come to Taniti for its white sand beaches, however if you travel to the other side of the mountain, the landscape looks like something out of a fantasy movie. The cliffs of Paenhanga are a scenic landmark where you can gaze down the towering cliffs of stone that were thrust from the Earth's crust millions of years ago. These cliffs serve as a fantastic view of the ocean for a romantic getaway.</p>

                    <p>A short boat ride from Yellow Leaf Bay is the Tanitian island of Vosika. Legends say this island in particular was blessed by Tanihalotep, as the island is surrounded by the massive Ulusoali'i Reef which serves as a breeding ground for hundreds of species of fish, many of which can only be found near the island. The island of Vosika is strictly protected by the Tanitian government, so the Ulusoali'i Reef has been properly maintained for all snorkelers and deep sea divers alike. While at the island, enjoy chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, diving and jet-ski rentals.</p>
