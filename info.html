                <h2>Electricity</h2>
                <p>Taniti uses the 120 volt standard for our electrical outlets. This is the same standard that is used in the United States. Travellers coming from Europe, Australia, South America, Africa and Asia may require adapters for their devices.</p>

                <h2>Currency</h2>
                <p>Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its main form of currency. Though, to accomodate the increasing demand, many businesses will also accept euros, yen and yuan. There are also several banks on Taniti which offer currency exchange services, with inventory on hand just in case of an emergency. Major credit cards are also accepted almost universally across the island, though it is still recommended to keep cash on hand, especially in more rural areas of the island.</p>

                <h2>Crime</h2>
                <p>Taniti has enjoyed a very low crime rate for quite some time. Violent crime still remains very rare on Taniti. But as tourism grows, there have been growing reports of pickpocketing and other petty crimes. When in large crowds, take extra care to watch your belongings.</p>

            <div class="info_block">
                <h2>Language</h2>
                <p>Many younger Tanitians speak English, however, most older Tanitians, especially those in more rural areas, do not speak much English at all. When planning your trip, think about the locations you'd like to visit, and inquire about the translation services provided in that area. Due to Taniti's growing economy and tourism, many businesses and other facilities typically have at least one multilingual employee.</p>

            <div class="info_block">
                <h2>Alcohol</h2>
                <p>Similarly to much of the world, Taniti has relatively relaxed laws surrounding alcohol, especially compared to the laws of the United States. Many travellers may find it easy to purchase and consume alcohol. However, keep in mind that Alcohol is not allowed to be served or sold between the hours of midnight and 9:00 A.M. Other than that, anybody over the age of 18 can enjoy alcoholic beverages, even in public spaces.</p>

                <h2>National Holidays</h2>
                <p>Taniti enjoys many national holidays, and while this does lead to many fun celebrations, keep in mind that many businesses, tourist attractions and restaraunts will be closed. Plan your trip accordingly if you are travelling around the time of a national holiday in Taniti.</p>

                <h2>Emergency Services</h2>
                <p>There is one major hospital on the island. There are also many different clinics spread throughout the island, so chances are you will still be able to recieve medical attention very quickly in the case of an emergency. The hospital also has many multilingual employees.</p>
